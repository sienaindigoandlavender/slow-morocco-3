            An EPIC journey gives you access to people, places, and knowledge that cannot be found in any guidebook, on any platform, or through any other operator. The wayfarer who reads the stars.

            An EPIC journey is built around the availability of people who do not operate on tourist schedules. The maâlem has his own life. The wayfarer moves with the seasons. The tracker follows the animals. We coordinate with them, not the other way around.
