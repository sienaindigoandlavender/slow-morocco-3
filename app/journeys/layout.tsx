const journeysFAQs = [
  {
    question: "Are Slow Morocco tours private?",
    answer: "Yes, all journeys are completely private. You travel only with your group, never with strangers. Your driver and guides are dedicated to you throughout.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize my Morocco itinerary?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Every journey is a starting point, not a script. Add days in the desert, skip cities, extend your stay anywhere that pulls you. We shape routes around your interests.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in the tour price?",
    answer: "All journeys include private transport with experienced driver, handpicked accommodations, local expert guides, and curated experiences. Meals vary by itinerary—typically breakfast daily plus select lunches and dinners.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book a Morocco tour?",
    answer: "We recommend booking 2-3 months ahead, especially for peak season (March-May, September-November). Last-minute bookings are sometimes possible but accommodation options may be limited.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best time to visit Morocco?",
    answer: "Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) offer ideal temperatures. Summer suits coastal and mountain destinations. Winter is perfect for the Sahara and southern regions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long should I spend in Morocco?",
    answer: "A week allows for highlights like Marrakech, the desert, and one other region. 10-14 days lets you explore more deeply—Imperial Cities, Atlas trekking, or the full north-to-south route.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Slow Morocco different from other tour operators?",
    answer: "Years of building relationships with artisans, musicians, guides, and families across Morocco. We offer access to people and places others miss—not just monuments, but living culture.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer Morocco desert tours?",
    answer: "Yes, we specialize in Sahara experiences. From single-night camps at Erg Chebbi (Merzouga) to multi-day expeditions at Erg Chigaga. Camel treks, 4x4 adventures, and luxury desert camps available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine cities and desert in one Morocco trip?",
    answer: "Absolutely—this is our most popular format. Classic routes include Marrakech to Merzouga (via Atlas and Dades Gorge), or Fes to desert to Marrakech. We design seamless itineraries connecting all regions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you arrange Atlas Mountains trekking?",
    answer: "Yes, from day hikes in the Ourika Valley to multi-day treks including Toubkal summit (North Africa's highest peak), Ait Bouguemez valley walks, and remote High Atlas traverses with mountain guides.",
